a gem providing some Dir and File methods for getting unixy and windows
file paths no matter what system one is on. e.g., be able to generate
 C:\Users\joe\Desktop      #Windows 
from 
 C:/Users/joe/Desktop      #native Ruby on Windows
or from 
 /cygdrive/c/Users/joe/Desktop      #native Ruby on Windows

It would be nice to be able to convert mapped drives to UNC
(and vice versa, though that is not neccessarily determinate).
This, however, may be hard.

maybe these are just String methods? Or new classes?
CygDir.new "C:\Users\joe\Desktop"
=> "/cygdrive/c/Users/joe/Desktop"
